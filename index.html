      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a canfitpro-certified Fitness Instructor Specialist and Personal Trainer Specialist based in Toronto. As an Army veteran, history buff, and historical fantasy writer, I bring discipline, creativity, and storytelling into every aspect of my work.</p>

<p>My passion for fitness began at 19, the moment I stepped into a boxing gym—and it has only grown stronger since. A dedicated boxing enthusiast, I had the privilege of training in the lineage of the legendary Ukrainian Olympian, Anatoliy Klimanov. My fitness journey also includes Jiu-Jitsu, which has deepened my understanding of strength, technique, and perseverance.</p>

<p>As a former soldier, I developed a strong leadership style, and my mission is to guide fitness beginners toward becoming the best versions of themselves. In my group classes and training sessions, I seamlessly incorporate boxing techniques while ensuring every participant breaks a sweat.</p>

<p>"Form over speed" and "Challenge yourself" are my go-to mantras—because true progress comes from mastering technique and pushing limits. Whether you're just starting out or looking to level up, I’m here to help you elevate your fitness and unleash your full potential.
